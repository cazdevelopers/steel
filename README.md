# steel
 An android app for sending notifications to a computer, and for sending texts from a computer (through a firebase data message).
 Very much a work in progress, and for the foreseeable future, is meant only for personal use.
 Intended to mimic the functionality of Pushbullet (without paying anyone) with the help of coreywoodfield/steel-mac
